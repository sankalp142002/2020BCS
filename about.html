    <h3>History</h3>
    Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management (IIITM) in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh is an autonomous
    institute set by Government of India, MHRD (Presently Ministry of Education, Govt. of India) in 1997. It is an
    effort by MHRD (Presently Ministry of Education, Govt. of India) towards creating professionals in areas of
    management and information technology from the same institute. This institute was created for facilitating
    higher education, research, and consultancy in areas of information technology (IT) and business management.
    Initially started as IIITM, this institute was prefixed with ABV in 2002 to honour the then Prime Minister Atal
    Behari Vajpayee.

    <h4>The Beginning</h4>

    The beginning of IIITM could be traced back to 1992, when MHRD (Presently Ministry of Education, Govt. of India)
    under Dr. P. G. Reddy contemplated setting up of advanced information systems in the likes of IIMs and IITs in
    different locations of India. Subsequently in 1995, Government of India based on a report prepared by AICTE (All
    India Council for Technical Education) comprising eminent academicians, policy makers, and professionals decided
    on establishing national centres focussed on IT and management training.

    PGDMIT (Post Graduate Diploma in Management and Information Technology) was the maiden course initiated in 1998
    with thirty students, followed by PGDIT (Post Graduate Diploma in Information Technology) in 1999, and Ph. D and
    5-year Dual Post Graduate programs in 2000.

    <h4>Committee</h4>

    This essentially was the committee set up by MHRD (Presently Ministry of Education, Govt. of India) under Dr. P.
    G. Reddy to study the comprehensive situation of software education and its utilization in India. With the
    demand for skilled information technology and management professionals reaching several thousands, it became
    necessary to establish specialised management and IT institutes similar to IIMs and IITs to bridge the gap
    between manpower demand and supply.

    <h4>Policy</h4>

    All pervasive growth of IT in India was triggered by Software Policy in 1986, Electronic Policy in 1985, and
    Computer Policy in 1984. These three policies in unison led to extensive use of computerised methods across
    different sectors of business, industries, and public administration thereby necessitating the need for
    competent professionals at different levels. Infrastructures like Internet, INDONET, NICNET, ERNET, and
    INFLIBNET were established for supporting this demand for widespread usage of computerised processes.
    <h4>Autonomy</h4>

    IIITM was set up as an autonomous institute under Societies Registration Act. This centrally funded body run by a
    Board of Governors aims at offering education, research, training, and consultancy in fields of management and IT in
    an integrated way.

    <h4>Role of State Government</h4>

    Supporting the cause of MHRD (Presently Ministry of Education, Govt. of India), Government of India in developing an
    integrated IT and management institute, Madhya Pradesh State Government offered nearly 61 hectares of land. This
    area on Morena Road and at the foothills of Gwalior fort is easily accessible from city airport and railway station.
